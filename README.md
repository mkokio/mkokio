__Bit More About Me__
 - Creativity is a big thing for me, from drawing silly pictures to woodworking fixtures.
 - Repairing things is the way to be, from a hole in my shoe to my old Subaru.
 - Cooking quite often is definitely the key, from mapo tofu on rice to the perfect pizza slice.
 - Bicycles equal happiness; I guarantee, from downhill-shredding thrills to winter-commute chills.
 - The ocean and sunshine will set you free, from surfing that gnarly right, to snorkeling at night.

__Adjacent Misc.__
 - Created weekly art and accompanying essays at [TotoroTuesday](https://www.instagram.com/totorotuesday/) from 2020 to 2022

__Recent interesting thing(s) I've learned__

 - ü§øYou can swim through an 18-meter-long bioluminescent tube of zooid clones called a pyrosome. Water is sucked up at one end and propelled out the other.
 - üïØBreathe in through your nose and out your mouth, strong enough to flicker a candle flame but not blow it out.
